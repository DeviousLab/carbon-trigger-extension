# Carbon Trigger Browser Extension

Huge props to Adebola who build a useful [extension](https://github.com/onedebos/covtension) for Chrome and Edge to track COVID country by country via API calls. He wrote an excellent [article](https://blog.adebola.dev/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension-that-makes-api-calls/) about it.

I have taken this code and edited it to work with tmrow's API to track electricity usage, so that you can have a reminder right in your browser about how heavy your region's electricity usage is, and to make judgement calls on your activities based on this information.
